### Help!

1. The size of the image section decreases in width and the content section increases in width when viewing in Firefox. I have been unable to research why. Any ideas?

2. I think it has to do with the way my .card was styled as the white background also shrinks without the text shrinking as well when making my chrome window smaller.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Media Queries

### What I learned

1. Improved on my Flexbox knowledge
2. How to replace an image using media query
3. Working with a SVG
4. Received feedback on my QR Code challenge - (The div 'container' can be eliminated if you use the body tag to target the same properties in the CSS as well.)
   - I used one less div container in this example. I think I did it correctly.

### Continued development

Take on feedback and implement it to improve this code.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with replacing and image using media query and how to use SVG files.
